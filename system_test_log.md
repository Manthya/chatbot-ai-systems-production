## Test: Context Check (General/Simple)
**Query**: "Hi, are you active?"

**Response** (174.96s):
Based on the current time being February 18, 2026, at 15:19 (likely a future date for testing purposes) and the repository status showing recent changes and untracked files, it appears that there is ongoing development activity in the system. The modifications to several Python scripts suggest active work on features or bug fixes within the chatbot AI system.

Since I've completed all steps without needing additional information from other tools, here's my final comprehensive answer:

The system is currently available but shows signs of recent updates and ongoing development activities as indicated by modified files and new untracked files in the repository. No specific time restrictions apply based on this data for further interactions or inquiries regarding the project status.

## Test: Filesystem Check (Simple Tool)
**Query**: "List files in the current directory"

**Response** (311.66s):
From the previous list_directory command response, I can see that the current directory contains a variety of items including files such as .env, README.md, alembic.ini, docker-compose.yml, and pyproject.toml among others. Directories include .git, alembic, docker, docs, frontend, media, scripts, src, tests and more.

This is what I found in the current directory:

- Files:
  - Configuration files: .env, .env.example
  - Project documentation: README.md
  - Database migration configuration: alembic.ini
  - Docker setup file: docker-compose.yml
  - Python project file: pyproject.toml
  - Environment requirements: requirements.txt
  - Log files: server.log, system_test_log.md
  - Ollama tags file: ollama_tags.json

- Directories:
  - Version control repository directory: .git
  - Database migration scripts and history: alembic
  - Docker configuration folder: docker
  - Documentation source code: docs
  - Frontend project files: frontend
  - Media files: media
  - Python virtual environment: .venv
  - Test scripts for the application: tests
  - Miscellaneous scripts: scripts
  - Source code of the server-side backend: src

This listing gives a comprehensive overview of the structure and content of the current working directory. It seems to be organized well with clear separation between source code, configuration, documentation, media files, test cases, and other supporting materials necessary for software development.
